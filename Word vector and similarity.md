# Word vectors 
In spacy every word can be easily represented to a vector and if the word is familiar and has a meaning then it is part of the model vocabulary.
If it is not part of the model that is the word is not so familiar with the common english then in its representation major dimensions will be zero
# Similarity
spaCy is able to compare two objects, and make a prediction of how similar they are. Predicting similarity is useful for building recommendation systems or flagging duplicates. For example, you can suggest a user content that’s similar to what they’re currently looking at, or label a support ticket as a duplicate if it’s very similar to an already existing one.
